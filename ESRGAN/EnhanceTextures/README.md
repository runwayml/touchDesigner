# Enhance Textures

Generation of realistic textures using **ESRGAN** models for image
super-resolution. This example reads low resolution textures, enhances
them, and sends its output to TouchDesigner.

### Requirements:
Requires Touchdesigner (2020 builds, SocketIO DAT added)

### Running the Example

* Download the project folder.
* Open RunwayML and create a workspace with the ESRGAN model. Check
  [RunwayML Learn](https://learn.runwayml.com/#/) for tutorials and
  additional information.
* Select **Network** and **Socket.io** to review the Socket.IO Server details.
* Run the model.
* Open the **EnhanceTextures.toe** file and press 'F1' to enter performance mode.
* Click on the `Port` field and input the port from Runway's Socket.IO Server address (default is `3000`).
* Click on the document icon ðŸ“„ next to the `File` field and select any texture from the `/images` subfolder.
* Wait until the upscaled image is rendered.
* Press 'Esc' to leave performance mode.
